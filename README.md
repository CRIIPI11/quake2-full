# Quake 2 Mod: Dead Ops Arcade üßü‚ò£Ô∏è

## How to Play
This mod is a replication of the secondary mode from COD: Zombies, Dead Ops Arcade. It tries to implement all the mechanics from it into Quake 2 to give it a whole new retro perspective. The game is play on the outside zone of the first map. The player's default weapon will be the a modded blaster which fires similar to the hyper blaster with unlimited ammo. By default the player's has two abilities, Nukes which kills all zombies currently spawned and can be activated with the same key used for quad damage on the original game ('Q' by default) and Teleporting which teleports the player to a different location of the map and activates with the same key used for the enviromental suit on the original game ('E' by deafult.). Others abilities such as Monkey Bombs, Chicken and Upgraded will be available through loot drops. As for the loot drops, they will spawn throughout the gameplay at random times and random locations. They will spawn for a limited time before dissapearing if not picked up by the player. Loot drops will spawn health, weapons and abilities, the last two only being able to be used for a limited amount of time right after picking them up. Zombies will spawn in endless amount of rounds, survive the longest and use you pwers wisely.
